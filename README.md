####Linear regression in ML?
Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm where the predicted output is continuous and has a constant slope. It’s used to predict values within a continuous range, (e.g. sales, price, income) rather than trying to classify them into categories (e.g. cat, dog). 


In other words linear regression uses traditional slope-intercept form, where m and b are the variables our algorithm will try to “learn” to produce the most accurate predictions. x represents our input data and y represents our prediction.

y=mx+b (m is slop or coefficient or gradient and b is intercept)
